##Welcome! 👨🏼‍💻

This is a challenge found in Frontendmentor.io

## The challenge

The challenge this time is to develop a landing page for a fictional businness called LoopStudios.
I have to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop this site and I have to make sure to make it responsive on any device.

## Building my project

I started working on the desktop first, I used the design images provided on the challenge hub, and started developing section by section.
The desktop part of it was easy since I already have practice with it, but where I started to feel more challenged was making the site responsive.
First I started optimizing the page for phones, this took me a bit of time since it was my first time doing it, but I started getting the hang of it little by little and when I was done with that, everything else was a little bit easier. I started optimizing for the iPad/tablet on portrait mode, then for landscape mode, and then I remembered I had forgotten the landscape mode for phones. Then I started working on the mobile menu to make it work in all smaller screens.
